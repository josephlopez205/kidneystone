## Dataset
The dataset that is used for the model came from the Kaggle dataset, [Kidney Stone Prediction Based on Urine Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/kidney-stone-prediction-based-on-urine-analysis).

## Model Used
Gradient Boosting Classification is used to predict the presence or absence of kidney stones in the urine sample. It uses the following parameters:
- Specific Gravity
- pH
- Osmolarity, in mOsm
- Conductivity, in mMho
- Urea Concentration, in mmol/L
- Calcium Concentration, in mmol/L
